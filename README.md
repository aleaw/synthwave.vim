# synthwave.vim

A dark Vim color scheme for the GUI and 256-color terminals, based on fsociety's
[synthwave](https://code.fsociety.info/dotfiles/file/nvim/.config/nvim/plugged/synthwave/colors/synthwave.vim.html) theme.

      let g:synthwave_termcolors=256 " 256 color mode
    endif

## vim-airline Theme

![airline-synthwave.vim Preview](https://raw.github.com/exitface/synthwave.vim/master/docs/preview_airline.png)

This repository includes a companion [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) theme for use with synthwave.vim.

The vim-airline theme:

* Depends on synthwave.vim for its colors, and must therefore be used in conjunction with it.
* Works with both color modes available in synthwave.vim (16 or 256 colors), as specified in the configuration for synthwave.vim.
* Is based on vim-airline's ["tomorrow" theme](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes/blob/master/autoload/airline/themes/tomorrow.vim).

### Installation

(These instructions assume that vim-airline and synthwave.vim are already installed and configured to your liking.)

Place `synthwave.vim/autoload/airline/themes/synthwave.vim` in your `~/.vim/autoload/airline/themes/` directory either manually or by using your Vim plug-in manager of choice, then add the following line to your `~/.vimrc`:

```vim
let g:airline_theme='synthwave'
```
